## Application Overview

The **Cert Prep Multi-Agent System** turns a 10-minute intake form into a complete, personalised certification study plan. Eight specialised AI agents collaborate in a typed sequential pipeline:

```
Intake Agent
  └──► Safety Guardrails
         └──► Learner Profiling Agent
                ├──► Study Plan Agent  ──────────────────────────────────┐
                └──► Learning Path Curator                               │
                       └──► Domain Confidence Scorer                    │
                              └──► Readiness Gate                        │
                                     ├── PASS (≥70%) → Cert Recommender ┤
                                     └── FAIL (<70%) → Remediation loop ┘
```

All agents run in **mock mode by default** — zero Azure OpenAI cost, instant sub-second response. Switch to live mode via `src/cert_prep/config.py → USE_MOCK = False`.

## Scenario 1 — AI Beginner (Alex Chen, AI-102)

**Persona:** Recent CS graduate, no cloud or Azure experience, 12 hours/week available over 10 weeks, wants to break into AI engineering.

### Step 1 — Load the Scenario

Click **🌱 AI Beginner · AI-102** in the sidebar. The form fills automatically:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Alex Chen |
| Exam | AI-102 – Azure AI Engineer Associate |
| Background | Recent CS graduate, basic Python, no cloud experience |
| Prior certs | *(none)* |
| Hours / week | 12 |
| Study weeks | 10 |
| Concern topics | Azure Cognitive Services, Azure OpenAI, Bot Service |

![Alex Chen scenario — pre-filled intake form](screenshots/02_alex_prefill_form.png)
*Caption: Intake form pre-filled for Alex Chen. All fields populated from the sidebar scenario button.*

### Step 2 — Generate the Profile

Click **🚀 Generate My Study Plan**. All eight agents run in under a second (mock mode).

![Profile generation loading](screenshots/03_alex_generating.png)
*Caption: Spinner shown while agents run. In mock mode this resolves in <1 second.*

### Step 3 — Domain Map (Tab 1)

The **Domain Map** tab shows Alex's readiness across all AI-102 exam domains as a coloured radar chart + sortable table:

- 🔴 **Red** domains (< 40% confidence) — highest priority gaps
- 🟠 **Orange** domains (40–64%) — needs work
- 🟢 **Green** domains (≥ 65%) — solid, can skim

**Expected output for Alex (beginner):** Nearly all domains in red/orange — the system correctly identifies a comprehensive study need with no skip recommendations.

![Alex — Domain Map radar chart](screenshots/04_alex_domain_map.png)
*Caption: Domain Map for Alex Chen. Red-dominant radar confirms beginner status. No domains are skip-recommended.*

### Step 4 — Study Setup (Tab 2)

Shows the parsed study schedule:

- **Total available hours** = 12 h/week × 10 weeks = **120 hours**
- Hours broken down by domain priority
- Warning displayed if total hours appear insufficient for the exam

![Alex — Study Setup hours breakdown](screenshots/05_alex_study_setup.png)
*Caption: Study Setup tab showing 120 total hours distributed across AI-102 domains based on confidence scores.*

### Step 5 — Learning Path (Tab 3)

The **Learning Path** tab shows a week-by-week curated curriculum with:
- Microsoft Learn modules linked per domain
- Estimated time per module
- Prerequisites flagged where applicable

**For Alex:** A 10-week full curriculum starting from Azure fundamentals before advancing to Cognitive Services and OpenAI.

![Alex — Learning Path weekly plan](screenshots/06_alex_learning_path.png)
*Caption: Learning Path for Alex Chen — week-by-week breakdown with module links.*

### Step 6 — Recommendations (Tab 4)

The **Cert Recommendation** agent outputs:

- Exam readiness indicator
- Pre-study recommendations (e.g., "Complete AZ-900 first")
- Risk domains that need the most attention
- Whether the learner is on a GO or REMEDIATION path

**For Alex:** System will recommend completing AZ-900 fundamentals as optional prep, and flag generative AI + responsible AI as risk domains.

![Alex — Recommendations panel](screenshots/07_alex_recommendations.png)
*Caption: Recommendations panel showing readiness indicator, risk domains, and suggested pre-study steps.*

### Step 7 — My Progress (Tab 5)

First visit shows a **Progress Check-In** form (HITL gate 1) — the learner self-reports hours studied and confidence. Submit to unlock the full progress analytics.

![Alex — Progress Check-In form](screenshots/08_alex_progress_gate.png)
*Caption: Human-in-the-loop gate 1 — learner submits self-reported progress before analytics unlock.*

### Step 8 — Knowledge Check (Tab 6)

Select a domain from the dropdown and click **🎯 Start Quiz**. A 5-question adaptive quiz runs. Score ≥ 70% → **GO** badge. Score < 70% → **REMEDIATE** badge with weak areas highlighted.

![Alex — Knowledge Check quiz in progress](screenshots/09_alex_quiz.png)
*Caption: Knowledge Check tab showing a 5-question quiz for the Azure OpenAI domain.*

![Alex — Quiz result with score < 70%](screenshots/10_alex_quiz_fail.png)
*Caption: Readiness Gate result for Alex — score below 70% triggers the REMEDIATION path with targeted review links.*

## Scenario 2 — Data Professional (Priyanka Sharma, DP-100)

**Persona:** 5-year data analyst, experienced in scikit-learn and Azure ML. Holds AZ-900 + AI-900. Targeting DP-100 in 6 weeks at 8 hrs/week. Goal: move into Azure ML Engineer role.

### Step 1 — Load the Scenario

Click **📊 Data Professional · DP-100** in the sidebar.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Priyanka Sharma |
| Exam | DP-100 – Azure Data Scientist Associate |
| Background | 5 yrs data analytics, Python, scikit-learn, Azure ML experiments |
| Prior certs | AZ-900, AI-900 |
| Hours / week | 8 |
| Study weeks | 6 |
| Concern topics | Hyperparameter tuning, model deployment, MLflow, data drift |
| Learning style | Video tutorials + Hands-on labs |
| Goal | Earn DP-100 for Azure ML Engineer role switch |
| Motivation | Role switch + Career growth |

![Priyanka — pre-filled intake form](screenshots/11_priyanka_prefill_form.png)
*Caption: Intake form pre-filled for Priyanka Sharma. Prior cert field shows AZ-900, AI-900.*

### Step 2 — Contrasting Domain Map

With an existing Python + Azure ML background, Priyanka's Domain Map looks starkly different from Alex's:

- Several domains in **green** (skip-recommended)
- Only concern areas (MLflow, data drift, deployment) remain orange/red
- Agent correctly detects prior certs and applies credit

**Key differentiator to highlight in the demo:** Same system, completely different output — the agents correctly personalise based on experience level.

![Priyanka — Domain Map — mostly green with targeted gaps](screenshots/12_priyanka_domain_map.png)
*Caption: Domain Map for Priyanka — mostly green with targeted gaps in MLflow and model monitoring. Green domains are skip-recommended.*

### Step 3 — Compressed Study Plan

- **Total hours** = 8 × 6 = 48 hours — focused, not exhaustive
- Skip-recommended domains free up hours for weak areas
- Study plan is materially shorter and more targeted than Alex's

![Priyanka — Study Setup — 48-hour compressed plan](screenshots/13_priyanka_study_setup.png)
*Caption: Study Setup for Priyanka — 48 hours distributed across only non-skip domains.*

### Step 4 — Cert Recommendation: GO Path

Because Priyanka holds prior certs and has strong fundamentals, the Readiness Gate score is typically above 70% — she is placed on the **GO** path immediately.

![Priyanka — Readiness Gate passes — GO badge](screenshots/14_priyanka_go_path.png)
*Caption: Readiness Gate result for Priyanka — GO path badge with cert booking recommendation.*

### Step 5 — Side-by-Side Comparison

| Dimension | Alex Chen (Beginner) | Priyanka Sharma (Expert) |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Study hours | 120 hrs | 48 hrs |
| Skip-recommended domains | 0 | 3–4 |
| Risk domains | 5–6 | 1–2 |
| Readiness path | REMEDIATE | GO |
| Pre-study suggestion | AZ-900 prep | None |
| Quiz pass rate (demo) | ~55% | ~82% |

This contrast is the **core showpiece** of the multi-agent personalisation.

## Learning Tabs Deep-Dive

After generating a profile, seven output tabs appear across the top of the page:

| Tab | What it shows | Key agent |
|-----|--------------|-----------|
| **1 · Domain Map** | Radar + bar chart of per-domain confidence | Domain Confidence Scorer |
| **2 · Study Setup** | Hours available, domain hour allocation, prereq warning | Study Plan Agent |
| **3 · Learning Path** | Week-by-week curated Microsoft Learn modules | Learning Path Curator |
| **4 · Recommendations** | Readiness verdict, cert booking guidance, risk domains | Cert Recommendation Agent |
| **5 · My Progress** | HITL check-in gate 1 + progress bar analytics | Progress Agent |
| **6 · Knowledge Check** | 5-question adaptive quiz + PASS/REMEDIATE gate | Assessment Agent |
| **7 · Raw Data** | Full JSON payloads for all agent I/O — for debugging | All agents |

Each tab has a **↑ Back to top** anchor and a one-liner purpose caption.

## Responsible AI Guardrails in Action

The `GuardrailsPipeline` runs **at every agent transition** — 17 rules across 6 categories:

| Category | Rules | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| PII Detection | Names/emails in background text | WARN — flags detected PII |
| Content Safety | Hateful, harmful, or off-topic text | BLOCK — pipeline halts |
| Data Validation | Missing required fields | BLOCK |
| Confidence Bounds | Scores outside 0–1 range | BLOCK |
| Scope Guard | Non-Microsoft exam targets | WARN |
| Session Integrity | Tampered or missing session state | BLOCK |

**Demo tip:** On the intake form, try typing `sarah@email.com` in the background field. The guardrail fires a PII warning badge visible in Tab 7 (Raw Data) and in the Admin Dashboard per-agent card for the Intake Agent.

**Data contracts (Pydantic):**  
`RawStudentInput` → `LearnerProfile` → `StudyPlan` / `LearningPath` → `ReadinessAssessment` → `CertRecommendation`

Every agent receives and returns a typed Pydantic model — no raw-string hand-offs, no hallucination-prone free-form dictionaries.
